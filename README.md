# About Vanishing NY


This data repository help visualize and commemorate their impact and history of buildings, businesses, and venues that have vanished in NY.

## Data

`vanishingny.csv` is the master list of all collected records. You will also find `txt` and `csv` files that contain identical data separated by year. These files contain the most recent data that has been cobtributed to the project. 

Use the `csv` data to create useful graphics and interactive visualizations.

`txt2csv.py` converts `txt` formatted data into many individual `csv` files and one master `vanishingny.csv` file. Run this command if you add new data to the txt files. 

Or add the data directly to the `csv`. 

Create a pull request and your contribution will be appreciated.

# About Vanishing NY


Data collected to help visualize and commemorate the history and impact of buildings, businesses, and venues that have vanished in NY.

## Data

[vanishingny.csv](../blob/master/vanishingny.csv) is the master list of all collected records. You will also find `txt` and `csv` files that contain identical data separated by year. These files contain the most recent data that has been cobtributed to the project. 

[txt2csv.py](../blob/master/txt2csv.py) converts `txt` formatted data into many individual `csv` files and one master `vanishingny.csv` file according to some fairly specific parsing logic. Run this command if you add new data to the txt files. 

Or add the data directly to the `csv` files. 

Create a pull request and your contribution will be appreciated.

## Where there's data, there's anti-data

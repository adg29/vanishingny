# About VanishingNY

As more buildings / businesses / venues around NY close and/or are forced to move, the contributes to this data repository help visualized and commemorate the vanishing history.

## Setup / Installation / Run

Run python txt2csv.py to convert copy pasted `txt` data into `csv`.

The `csv` is useful for creating graphics and interactive visualizations. 

Both `txt` and `csv` contain identical data, but in different formats. Both `txt` and `csv` files in the repository will contain the most recent data that has been cobtributed into the repository. 

Run again if you add new data to the txt files. Or add it directly to the CSV. Create a pull request and your contribution will be appreciated.

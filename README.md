# About Vanishing NY

As more buildings, businesses, and venues in NY vanish, the contributoions to this data repository help visualize and commemorate their impact and history.

## Data

Both `txt` and `csv` contain identical data, but in different formats. These files contain the most recent data that has been cobtributed to the project. Use the `csv` data to create useful graphics and interactive visualizations.

`txt2csv.py` converts `txt` formatted data into `csv`. Run this command if you add new data to the txt files. 

Or add the data directly to the CSV. 

Create a pull request and your contribution will be appreciated.
